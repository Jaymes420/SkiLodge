            <h3>Rental Tips</h3><br><br>
            <h3>Where to Rent</h3><br>

            <p>There are a couple of options for renting ski equipment. Many local ski shops rent equipment packages. One advantage to renting locally is that you can pick up your equipment ahead of time and avoid waiting in a line at the resort ski shop.</p><br>
            <p>
                On the other hand, if you rent equipment at the resort you may be able to store your equipment during the day or overnight free or for a nominal fee. You can also rent ski equipment online and have it delivered to your hotel or condo.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Renting Ski Equipment</h3><br>


            <p> Most rental packages include skis, boots, and poles. You should be able to choose from beginner or performance skis. Special packages are available for junior skiers. Helmets may be available for an additional charge, which can be as low as $10. That extra expense is well worth the safety you or your child gains by wearing a helmet.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that when you sign up for a ski lesson program, the package should include equipment that you can use all day so you do not need to rent it separately. You'll be outfitted with everything you need prior to your lesson.</p>

            <h3>Here's a list of ski equipment available to rent:</h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li>Ski's</li>
                <li>Ski Poles</li>
                <li> Helmet</li>
                <li>Ski Jacket & pants</li>
                <li>Snowboard</li>
            </ul><br><br>

            <h3>Ski Rental Options</h3><br>
            <p>
                Skiers can rent a package or rent items individually. For example, Deer Valley Resort offers full-day and afternoon-only packages for juniors, for beginners, and even for intermediate and advanced skiers. You can rent a full set of equipment, skis only, or boots only. Helmets and poles are available separately.</p><br>

            <h3>Ski Rental Pricing</h3><br>
            <p>
                Rental equipment prices vary depending on the type of equipment you are renting, where you are renting from, and how long you are renting it for. Some packages start as low as $20 per day, while others can cost $50 or more. Some resorts automatically add on damage insurance, for a few dollars per day.</p><br>

            <h3>Plan Ahead</h3><br>
            <p>
                Plan ahead and reserve your ski rental equipment in advance, especially during busy holiday weeks and school vacation weeks. That way you'll know for certain that the equipment you want is available and ready when you arrive to pick it up.</p><br>

            <h3>What You Need to Buy</h3><br>
<p>
    You will need to invest in ski clothing. At the least, you will need a warm ski jacket and snow pants, gloves, a layer of long underwear, warm socks, and goggles. The following is a list of what you will need to wear to feel comfortable on the slopes:</p><br>
            <ul>


                <li>Gloves</li>
                <li> Goggles</li>
                <li> Hat or helmet liner</li>
                <li> Long underwear</li>
                <li> Ski socks</li>
                <li> Ski pants and jacket</li>
                <li> Turtleneck and sweater or fleece</li>


            </ul>
