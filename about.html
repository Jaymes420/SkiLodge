            <h3>Meet the Owners:</h3><br>
<p>
Jeff & Jessica found Thunder Mountain Lodge a few years back and fell in love.  When the opportunity arose to purchase the business, they took advantage of this new adventure.  Jeff moved to Colorado from Wisconsin in 1998.  A short 10 years later in 2008, Jessica moved to Colorado from Pennsylvania. They both found themselves in the Vail area to pursue their passion for snowboarding.  That passion expanded to one for all of the outdoor activities that Colorado had to offer.</p><br>
<p>
    Jeff worked as a snowmobile and raft guide for more than 15 years in the Vail area.  Eventually, Ski-doo scooped him up to become the VIP tour manager, a position he held for 4 years. During the winter, he is almost always out on his snowmobile. Although he has been know to ice climb once in a while. When the snow melts, you can find him guiding people on some of the toughest white water around. Or climbing to the top of Colorado’s 14,000 foot peaks. Or maybe he’s out ripping it up on his dirt bike. But the duties of Thunder Mountain Lodge may cut into his outdoor time. He will be plowing, shoveling, and doing repairs all over the property.  You’ll find Jessica helping with all of that too!  She also worked as a snowmobile and raft guide for 2 years in the Vail area.  She now guides the two hour and half day snowmobile tours for the lodge.  Their love for the outdoors is what brought them together.  September 2015, they tied the knot at Thunder Mountain Lodge!  Come visit and get to know the new enthusiastic owners!</p><br>

        <h3> Cabin Rules</h3><br>
            
<p>
    Renting a cabin in the wilderness is much different than renting a room in a city or town. For your safety, our safety, and forest safety please be respectful of the area around you. Remember that you are staying at an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea 
    level. Please drink plenty of water and eat well during your stay.</p><br>
 <p>          
     There is a two night minimum for all cabins. A one night reservation is allowed midweek, but there is an additional fee of $20.  On holidays we have a 3 night minimum:  Christmas to New Years week, Presidents weekend in February, July 4th weekend, & Labor Day weekend.</p><br>

            <h3>Reservation Rates:</h3>  <br>
            <p>
            Cabin rates are based on double occupancy.  Each additional person or pet is an extra $10 per night.  (Kids six and under are free.)</p><br>


            <h3>Deposit & Final Payment:</h3><br>
 <p>         
     In order to reserve a cabin, you must pay a deposit of 50%. The final payment is 14 days before arrival. Groups of 5 cabins or more must be paid in full 30 days before check in.</p><br>


            <h3>Check In/Out:</h3><br>
 <p>          
Check in time is 4 pm and check out time is 11 am. If you would like early check in or late check out, please talk to us in advance.
            </p><br>

            <h3>Cancellations:</h3><br>
<p>            
    Cancellations prior to 30 days can be refunded minus a 10% fee. Within 30 days of your check in date, your deposit is non-refundable. Otherwise, rescheduling is possible with management approval.</p><br>
<p>
    Because we are located in the mountains, weather is not a reason for cancellation. Please be prepared for mountain driving in all types of weather. During the winter, there is the possibility that Highway 65 from I-70 is closed, the other way through Grand Junction, to Delta, then through Cedaredge will be open.</p><br>


            <h3>Additional Vehicles, RVs, & Tents:</h3><br>
 <p>          
     There is ample parking for all cabin guests. If you would like to park and RV on site, it is $20/night. We do not have any hook ups, and generators must be turned off after 9 pm. Tents are allowed to be put up outside your cabin for an additional $10/tent/night.</p><br>


            <h3>No Smoking:</h3><br>
            <p>
                Smoking is not allowed in any of the cabins. There will be an additional fee of $250 if smoking is detected in any of the cabins. If you do smoke, please do so outside and clean up after yourself. Our grounds are to remain clean of all litter including cigarette butts</p>



    <h3>Telephones/Televisions/Internet:</h3><br>
<p>            
    We do not have telephones or televisions in any of our cabins. You may use the telephone in our office during office hours. We have complimentary long distance. There is wifi in the lodge, and you may be able to use it in your cabin. Otherwise, you may visit the lodge/office during hours.</p><br>


    <h3>Pets Are Welcome:</h3><br>
            <p>
                All of our cabins are pet friendly. We charge an additional $10/pet/night. Please clean up after your pets and dispose of their waste properly. Please do not allow your pets on the furniture.</p><br>
